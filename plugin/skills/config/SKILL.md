# config

Use this skill when the user wants to configure claw-kit behavior.

This skill is a configuration entrypoint, not a planning workflow and not a direct file mutation command.
It helps decide which config surface should change, then gives the correct field shape.

## First question

Before recommending or making a config change, establish which scope the user wants:

- Team config:
  - write `.claw/project.json`
  - commit the change when it should be shared by the repository
  - use this for project-wide workflow behavior, shared external skill choices, recall paths, and GitNexus integration
- Personal config:
  - write `.claw/project-override.json`
  - keep it local and gitignored
  - use this for one person's runtime preference, temporary local overrides, or machine-specific choices

If the user has not made the scope clear, ask a concise question before editing:

`Should this be a shared team config change in .claw/project.json, or a personal local override in .claw/project-override.json?`

Do not guess the scope when the consequence matters.

## Config surfaces

### Team config

`.claw/project.json` is the canonical team-owned declaration.
It is normalized by `claw init` and protocol repair.

Use it when the team should share the behavior:

- `planning`
- `autoUpdate`
- `externalPlanningSkill`
- `contextPaths`
- `memory.externalDocPaths`
- `memory.embedding`
- `goalMode`
- `knowledgeWriter.externalSkills`
- `knowledgeWriter.executionPolicy`
- `knowledgeWriter.model`
- `knowledgeWriter.reasoningEffort`
- `knowledgeWriter.datedSectionsToKeep`
- `gitnexus`

### Personal config

`.claw/project-override.json` is a local runtime-only overlay.
It deep-merges over `.claw/project.json`.
It is gitignored by default and must not be treated as a second canonical config file.

Use it when the change should affect only the current checkout or user.

Example personal override:

```json
{
  "goalMode": false,
  "knowledgeWriter": {
    "externalSkills": ["truth-writer", "adr-writer"],
    "model": "gpt-5.6-terra",
    "reasoningEffort": "high"
  }
}
```

Example personal planning override:

```json
{
  "planning": true,
  "externalPlanningSkill": "my-planning-skill"
}
```

Example personal GitNexus override:

```json
{
  "gitnexus": true
}
```

Nested objects still use normal JSON merge behavior.
Arrays replace inherited arrays rather than appending to them.
Explicit `null` is a real override value, not inheritance.

## Field shape

Use the flat canonical fields for simple project-level toggles:

```json
{
  "planning": true,
  "autoUpdate": true,
  "externalPlanningSkill": null,
  "goalMode": true,
  "gitnexus": false
}
```

Keep nested shape only where the field actually has substructure:

```json
{
  "knowledgeWriter": {
    "executionPolicy": "background",
    "externalSkills": [],
    "model": null,
    "reasoningEffort": "medium",
    "datedSectionsToKeep": 6
  },
  "memory": {
    "externalDocPaths": ["docs/"],
    "embedding": {
      "provider": "local",
      "model": "jinaai/jina-embeddings-v2-base-zh",
      "outputDimensionality": 768
    }
  }
}
```

The default local model is `jinaai/jina-embeddings-v2-base-zh` at 768 dimensions. Two supported Snowflake alternatives are:

- `Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-m-v2.0` at 768 dimensions for projects that accept higher model, CPU, and memory cost.
- `Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-xs` at 384 dimensions for explicit low-resource or English-oriented use. It is not recommended for Chinese-heavy recall because the claw search comparison found substantial Chinese semantic-recall regressions.

`knowledgeWriter.executionPolicy` accepts `background` or `subagent` and defaults to `background`. Codex honors that selection. In Cindy, both values normalize to the compatibility value `subagent` and always create or reuse a persistent, UI-visible Orca `knowledge-finalizer` Worker; they never select a native subagent. The project knowledge-writer configuration authorizes that Worker. The finalizer runs an ordered documentation-governance assignment sequence. `knowledgeWriter.externalSkills` replaces the built-in default assignment. Custom skills receive an explicit unattended, non-interactive invocation envelope; an empty or absent list uses the hidden built-in governance contract with its own direct wording. This is configuration fallback, not failure fallback. `model = null` uses the host default model. `reasoningEffort` accepts `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, or `xhigh`. `datedSectionsToKeep` is a non-negative integer; it caps only complete evolution sections marked by `<!-- dated: YYYY-MM-DD -->` in each canonical document changed by the built-in writer. It does not limit current prose by length or age.

## Safe editing flow

1. Determine team vs personal scope.
2. Read the current target file if it exists.
3. Preserve unrelated fields.
4. Apply only the requested config change.
5. Keep JSON valid and formatted with two-space indentation.
6. After changing `.claw/project.json`, use Cindy's Ghost `list_tools` and `call_tool` operations to run the available validation or context operation; never invoke the claw CLI from the Agent prompt.
7. Do not run protocol repair expecting it to write `.claw/project-override.json`; override files are local runtime input only.

## Guardrails

- Do not put personal preferences into `.claw/project.json` unless the user explicitly wants a shared team change.
- Do not commit `.claw/project-override.json`.
- Do not describe `.claw/project-override.json` as canonical.
- Do not recommend legacy nested toggle shapes as the normal format.
- Use `memory.enabled` only as the documented master switch for project memory, task memory, embedding refresh, and `claw search`; do not substitute an invented toggle.
- Do not invent new config fields when an existing canonical field covers the need.
