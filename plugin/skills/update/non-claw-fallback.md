# Codex update fallback

Use this path only when no `.claw` project is available.

1. Confirm the target claw-kit version is published.
2. Refresh the CLI with `npm install -g @veewo/claw@latest` and verify it with `claw --version` plus `npm list -g @veewo/claw --depth=0`.
3. Add the official marketplace with `codex plugin marketplace add chanyuenpang/claw-kit --ref main` when missing, or refresh it with `codex plugin marketplace upgrade claw-kit`.
4. Install or enable `claw-kit@claw-kit`; disable or remove `claw-kit@claw-kit-local`.
5. Verify the enabled identity, marketplace source, source manifest, and matching cache manifest all identify the target version.
6. Restart Codex, start a new task, and verify the loaded `update` skill comes from that version.

Do not use a local marketplace, unpublished checkout, or cache-directory existence as proof of success. Report CLI and Codex plugin status separately.
