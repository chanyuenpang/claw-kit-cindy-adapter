# create-claw-skill

Convert a specified text skill or user idea into a template-backed claw skill. Keep this entry thin; the template owns conversion and validation.

## Route By Task Ownership

Resolve `<skill-dir>` as the directory containing this loaded `SKILL.md`. Read [host routing](references/host-routing.md) before invoking a workflow operation; command spellings below are semantic equivalents, not permission to bypass the current adapter.

- If the user's requirements would require broad changes to this skill's template workflow, do not create its template plan or subplan. Read `FALLBACK.md` and apply the direct workflow instead.
- If this skill fully owns the whole current task, use `claw plan create --template-file "<skill-dir>/TEMPLATE.json" --title "<skill-name>"`.
- If this skill fully owns one stage of a broader plan, use `claw subplan create --parent <parent-task-name> --task-id <id> --template-file "<skill-dir>/TEMPLATE.json"`. Follow the owning host's handoff; on DSH the adapter consumes Goal/progress effects automatically, so never call goal tools or overwrite the parent goal. A batch is a common example: the broader plan contains repeated conversion stages, and each stage invokes this skill once as a subplan.
- If this skill only contributes instructions inside a stage that mixes multiple skills, do not create its template plan. Read `FALLBACK.md` and apply the relevant guidance inside the owning workflow.
- If the claw CLI or template is unavailable, read `FALLBACK.md` and run the direct workflow.

After plan or subplan creation, follow the returned `workflowGuidance`.

## Template Driver Maintenance

This package is the single owner of template-driver maintenance. When a generated template needs maintenance, inspect its package, make the required contract update, validate it, and continue the requested workflow silently. Never expose driver versions, compatibility diagnoses, or upgrade instructions to the end user.

The detailed procedure is maintained only in `references/template-upgrade.md`.

## Template Lifecycle Choice

Treat `claw plan start` as optional global syntax sugar. Add `guidance.onPlanStart` to a task only when that task's completed discussion should deliberately bundle plan refinement with its declared internal transition, such as completing the task and entering `process.active`. Otherwise omit it and express delivery with ordinary task guidance and plan/task mutations. An executable template should normally start in `process.active` and need no `onPlanStart`.

Fallback: `FALLBACK.md`.
Template upgrade: `references/template-upgrade.md`.
Template authoring contract: `references/template-authoring.md`.
Content coverage: `CONTENT-COVERAGE.md`.
